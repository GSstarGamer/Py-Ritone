# Py-Ritone

Py-Ritone is a zero-setup local bridge between a Fabric Minecraft client (with Baritone installed) and Python.

## Monorepo Layout

- `mod/`: Fabric client mod (`pyritone_bridge`) exposing a local NDJSON socket bridge.
- `python/`: PyPI-ready package (`pyritone`) with async client, sync wrapper, and CLI.
- `protocol/`: Versioned bridge protocol docs and JSON schema.
- `docs/`: Developer setup and runbook.

## Quick Start

1. Install Minecraft Fabric client for 1.21.8.
2. Install Baritone `v1.15.0` mod.
3. Build or install `pyritone_bridge` mod jar into your client mods folder.
4. Install Python package:

```bash
pip install pyritone
```

5. Start Minecraft client. Py-Ritone opens `127.0.0.1:27841` automatically.
6. Use the package:

```python
from pyritone import PyritoneClient

with PyritoneClient() as client:
    print(client.ping())
    print(client.status_get())
    print(client.execute("goto 100 70 100"))
```

## One-Click Dev Client

- Double-click `run_dev_client.bat` at repo root, or run it in terminal:

```powershell
.\run_dev_client.bat
```

- In VS Code, use the task button:
  - `Terminal` -> `Run Build Task` -> `Py-Ritone: Build and Run Dev Client`

This compiles and starts the Fabric dev client, and auto-downloads Baritone for dev runtime.

## Security Model (v1)

- Bridge binds to loopback only.
- Auth token is generated by the mod and written to:
  - `<minecraft>/config/pyritone_bridge/bridge-info.json`
- Python auto-discovers this file by default.
